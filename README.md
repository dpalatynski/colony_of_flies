# Colony of flies  
Nowadays, a lot of forests are cut out to make a lot of space for roads and highways. In the forest live a lot of animals and insects. In this simulation I will consider colony of flies in place, where that highway was built. What is more, from the beginning of simulation that highways will be broaden (because, it’s common to wide roads to make more lanes). Fly is an object, which moves with a bit modified Brown Motion. Flies can set an egg and after defined time this egg can hatch and change for a lot flies. Cars are appeared at defined time with Mixed Poisson process. Car collision with flies or eggs cause death for insects.  

Users can change parameters like:  
•	size_of_breeding – number of flies hatched from egg,  
•	p – probability of setting an egg by one fly in time t (even a little change in that parameter can happen huge increase number of flies),  
•	inititial_number_of_flies – initial number of flies,  
•	N_t - intensity of appearing cars on the screen
